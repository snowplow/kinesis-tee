## Overview

Kinesis Tee is like **[Unix tee] [tee]**, but for Kinesis streams. Use it to:

1. Transform the format of a Kinesis stream
2. Filter records from a Kinesis stream based on rules
3. Write a Kinesis stream to another Kinesis stream

Rules to apply to your Kinesis stream (e.g. for filtering) are written in JavaScript.

## How it works

You configure Kinesis Tee with a self-describing Avro configuration file containing:

1. A single **source stream** to read records from
2. A single **sink stream** to write records to
3. An optional array of **stream operator** that are applied in series
    - to convert the records to another supported format
    - to determine whether to write the records to the sink stream

Here is an example:

```json
{
  "name": "My Kinesis Tee example",
  "targetStream": {
    "name": "my-target-stream",
    "targetAccount": null
  },
  "operator": {
      "array": [{
        "operatorType": "TRANSFORM_BUILT_IN",
        "value": "SNOWPLOW_ENRICHED_EVENT_TO_NESTED_JSON"
      }]
    }
}
```
